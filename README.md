# EventDatabase

## ERD Concept:

#### Venue:
venue_id (Primary Key)

name

address

capacity

#### Event:
event_id (Primary Key)

name

description

start_time

end_time

venue_id (Foreign Key)

#### Customer:
customer_id (Primary Key)

name

email

phone_number

#### Booking:
booking_id (Primary Key)

customer_id (Foreign Key)

event_id (Foreign Key)

booking_date

status (e.g., Confirmed, Pending)

#### Service:
service_id (Primary Key)

name

description

price

#### Event_Service:
Composite table to link events with services
Attributes:

event_id (Foreign Key)

service_id (Foreign Key)

#### Relationships:
A venue can host multiple events.
An event can have multiple bookings and services.
A customer can make multiple bookings.

## Technologies

#### Frontend:
React.js for a user-friendly interface to manage venues, events, and bookings.

#### Backend:
Node.js for API development.

#### Database:
PostgreSQL for persistent data storage.
Redis for caching frequently accessed data like event schedules.

#### Caching Strategy:
Use a cache-aside strategy with Redis to improve read performance for high-demand queries like available venues or event details.

#### Failover Strategy:
Deploy the system across multiple datacenters using a cloud provider like AWS.
Implement automated failover using a load balancer and database replication.

#### Concurrency Management:
Use optimistic locking or database transactions to handle simultaneous bookings for the same event.

#### Scalability:
Horizontal scaling of the backend using container orchestration tools like Kubernetes.
Optimize database queries with indexing on frequently queried fields.
